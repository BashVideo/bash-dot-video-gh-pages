        <p>
          We’re thrilled to announce that the team here at Bash Video is joining
          Roblox, a global platform bringing millions of people together through
          shared experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we started Bash in 2020, we recognized the profound need for
          people to stay connected, share experiences and have fun in new ways –
          and we built our video conferencing application focused on social
          gathering. Now, we are moving to the next phase of our journey. We
          believe the pandemic has permanently shaped the future of
          human-to-human interactions and behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roblox has a compelling vision to build a UGC platform where billions
          of people can come together to play, learn, work and share experiences
          in immersive 3D environments. Key to this is empowering its developer
          community around the world to reach a massive audience, build their
          skills, and be rewarded for their creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before Bash, our team helped build Kongregate – one of the first
          platforms that enabled indie developers to do all of these things. Our
          team will be joining the Developer Group at Roblox to share our
          collective entrepreneurial, engineering and product development
          expertise to benefit the growing Roblox development community.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we’re not the only ones who are excited. Our kids and their
          friends are too! They are playing on Roblox, and learning to build
          their own experiences. The chance to help the next generation of
          creators learn to code and collaborate speaks to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we’d like to thank everyone who has supported us to get here
          - our users, our families, and our investors, led by Bloomberg Beta
          and Precursor Ventures.
